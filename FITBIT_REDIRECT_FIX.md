# Fitbit Redirect URI Fix

This document explains how to fix the Fitbit OAuth authentication redirection issues in the MoodBeats app.

## Issue Description

The app was experiencing problems with the Fitbit OAuth flow, where after authenticating on the Fitbit website, the redirection back to the app wasn't working properly. This resulted in users having to manually enter their access tokens.

## Root Causes

1. **Mismatched Redirect URIs**: The app was using inconsistent redirect URIs across different components.
2. **Incomplete Authentication Handling**: The app wasn't properly processing all possible redirect formats from Fitbit.
3. **Browser Dismissal Issues**: On some mobile devices, the browser session was being dismissed before completing the authentication flow.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Unified Redirect URI

All parts of the app now consistently use `https://moodbeats.netlify.app/` as the redirect URI:

- In `FitbitAuthService.ts`: The redirect URI is set to the Netlify URL
- In `App.tsx`: Deep linking configuration uses the same URI
- In `app.json`: The URL scheme and redirect URIs are properly configured
- In Netlify HTML page: All auth links use the correct URI with proper permissions

### 2. Enhanced Token Extraction

- The redirect handling now considers multiple token formats:
  - Hash fragment: `#access_token=...`
  - Query parameter: `?access_token=...`
  - Mixed formats: URLs that might contain the token in various positions
  
- Added better error handling when the token isn't found
- Added a direct token validation with Fitbit API as a fallback

### 3. Improved Netlify Redirect Page

- The Netlify page now tries multiple redirect methods in sequence:
  - Direct app scheme: `moodbeats://fitbit-callback?access_token=...`
  - Hash fragment: `moodbeats://#access_token=...`
  - Query parameters: `moodbeats://?access_token=...`
  - Specific screen: `moodbeats://fitbit-connect?access_token=...`
  - Universal link: `https://moodbeats.netlify.app/auth?access_token=...`

- Added better user guidance when automatic redirection fails
- Token is now automatically displayed after failed redirects

### 4. Better User Experience

- Added clear instructions before initiating OAuth
- Implemented proper timeout for the loading state
- Added fallback options for manual token entry

## How to Test the Fix

1. Start the app using `npm start` or `npx expo start`
2. Navigate to the Fitbit Connect screen
3. Tap "Sign in with Fitbit"
4. Complete the authentication on the Fitbit website
5. You should be automatically redirected back to the app

If for any reason the redirect doesn't work automatically:

1. The Netlify page will show a button to manually open the app
2. It will also display the token for easy copy/paste
3. Use the "Having trouble connecting?" option to enter the token manually

## Technical Details

### Deep Linking Configuration

The app is configured to handle the following URL schemes:

```
moodbeats://
https://moodbeats.netlify.app
```

These are registered in:
- `app.json`: In the scheme and prefixes sections
- `App.tsx`: In the linking configuration

### Authentication Flow

1. App opens Fitbit authorization URL in a browser
2. User signs in and approves access
3. Fitbit redirects to `https://moodbeats.netlify.app/` with the token
4. The Netlify page attempts multiple methods to redirect back to the app
5. On success, the app stores the token and loads user profile data

### Manual Token Handling

If the automatic redirect fails, the app provides two options:

1. **Open App Button**: Tries to open the app with the token in the URL
2. **Manual Token Entry**: Displays the token for easy copy/paste into the app

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for "WebBrowser result: dismiss" which indicates the browser was closed prematurely
2. **Try Different Browser**: Some devices allow selecting different browsers for OAuth
3. **Network Issues**: Ensure stable internet connection
4. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing the app cache or reinstalling

## Additional Notes

- The Netlify site is hosted at https://moodbeats.netlify.app/
- The Fitbit Developer App is configured with this URI as a valid redirect
- The app supports both manual and automatic authentication methods

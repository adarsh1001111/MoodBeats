# MoodBeats Fixed README

## Fixed Issues

1. **Navigation Error**: Fixed a critical issue with the navigation system where the `navigation` property wasn't being properly initialized, causing runtime errors.

2. **Navigation Reference Management**: Implemented a centralized NavigationService to properly manage navigation references throughout the app.

3. **IP Configuration**: Updated the ML API endpoint in MoodAnalytics to use localhost by default.

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added better error checks for navigation operations to prevent crashes.

5. **Better App Startup**: Created a unified startup script that sets up the IP, starts the ML server, and launches the app.

## How to Start the App

You can now run the app with a single command:

```
./fixed_start.sh
```

This script will:
1. Set up IP configuration
2. Start the ML server in the background
3. Launch the main app

Alternatively, you can still use the individual scripts:
- `./start.sh` - Start just the app without ML capabilities
- `./start_with_ml.sh` - Start the ML server

## Technical Changes

1. Created a `NavigationService.ts` utility to manage navigation references
2. Updated App.tsx to use the NavigationService
3. Fixed navigation references in all components
4. Added proper type checking for navigation operations
5. Improved error handling for navigation actions
6. Updated API endpoint in MoodAnalytics component

## Note for Developers

If you experience any issues with the ML server, you can manually check its status by opening:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/status
```

The server should respond with `{"status": "ok"}` if everything is working correctly.

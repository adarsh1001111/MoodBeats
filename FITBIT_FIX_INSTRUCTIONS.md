# MoodBeats Fitbit Integration Fix

This document explains how I've fixed the Fitbit connection issues that were causing 401 Unauthorized errors in the MoodBeats app.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Changed Redirect URI to Match Fitbit Dashboard

The redirect URI in the app must **exactly** match what's configured in your Fitbit Developer Dashboard. I changed it from:
```
https://moodbeats.netlify.app
```
to:
```
https://moodmusicapp.netlify.app
```

This is likely the most important fix, as OAuth 2.0 requires exact matching URIs.

### 2. Switched to Implicit Grant Flow

Reverted to using the Implicit Grant Flow that was working in your original implementation instead of the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. The implicit flow is simpler and works better for mobile apps.

```typescript
static async authorize(flowType = AUTH_FLOW_IMPLICIT): Promise<boolean> {
```

### 3. Simplified Token Extraction

Modified the token extraction logic in the implicit grant callback to be more straightforward. This reduces the chances of errors when parsing the returned token.

### 4. Standardized Authorization Headers

Updated all API calls to use a consistent Authorization header format:

```typescript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token.accessToken}`,
  'Accept': 'application/json'
}
```

### 5. Removed tokenType Field

Removed the tokenType field from the ApiToken interface since we know Fitbit always uses Bearer tokens:

```typescript
export interface ApiToken {
  accessToken: string;
  refreshToken?: string; 
  expiresAt: number;
  userId?: string;
  scope?: string;
}
```

### 6. Used the Original Scopes

Returned to the original scopes that were working in your app:

```
heartrate activity profile settings sleep
```

## How to Test the Fix

1. Run the app
2. Go to the Fitbit Connect screen
3. Tap "Sign in with Fitbit"
4. Complete the authorization
5. Verify that the Fitbit connection works and heart rate data is being displayed

## If Issues Persist

If you still encounter 401 errors:

1. Check the Fitbit Developer Dashboard to ensure the redirect URI exactly matches `https://moodmusicapp.netlify.app`
2. Verify that your app is registered as a "Personal" app in the Fitbit Developer Dashboard
3. Make sure you have granted all necessary permissions during authorization
4. Check that your Fitbit account has heart rate data available

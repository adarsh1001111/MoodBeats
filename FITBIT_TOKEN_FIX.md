# Fixing Fitbit Authentication Issues

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve the Fitbit authentication token issues in the MoodBeats app.

## Problems Fixed

1. **Missing validateToken Function**: The error "Error saving token: [TypeError: _FitbitAuthService.default.validateToken is not a function (it is undefined)]" occurred because the `validateToken` function was missing from the FitbitAuthService.

2. **Deprecated expo-random Package**: Errors related to "expo-random is deprecated in favor of expo-crypto" were occurring during the Fitbit authentication process.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Created FitbitTokenValidator**: Added a dedicated utility for validating Fitbit tokens:
   - Located at `src/utils/FitbitTokenValidator.ts`
   - Provides a standalone `validateFitbitToken` function
   - Works independently of the main FitbitAuthService

2. **Updated ManualTokenScreen**: Modified the ManualTokenScreen to use the new validator:
   - Replaced the import for FitbitAuthService
   - Updated the call to use validateFitbitToken instead

3. **Added ExpoRandomShim**: Created a compatibility layer for the deprecated expo-random:
   - Located at `src/utils/ExpoRandomShim.ts`
   - Implements getRandomBytesAsync and assertByteCount using expo-crypto
   - Includes fallback mechanisms in case expo-crypto fails
   - Imported at the beginning of App.tsx to ensure it's available globally

## How to Test

1. Open the app and go to the Fitbit Connect screen
2. Tap "Sign in with Fitbit"
3. Complete authentication on the Fitbit website
4. The app should successfully redirect and connect to your Fitbit account without errors

If automatic connection fails:
1. The token will be displayed on the Netlify page
2. Use the "Manual Token Entry" option in the app
3. Paste the token and connect manually

The fixes ensure that both the automatic OAuth flow and the manual token entry method work correctly.

# Fitbit Authentication Fix

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve the Fitbit authentication redirect issue. The issue was occurring when the app failed to properly handle the redirect from Fitbit's authentication website back to the app.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Redirect URI Mismatch**: The app was configured with different redirect URIs in different places:
   - Fixed `FitbitAuthService.ts` to use `https://moodbeats.netlify.app` consistently
   - Updated `App.tsx` deep linking configuration to match the same URI
   - Added proper URI listing in `app.json`

2. **Token Parsing**: Improved token parsing in multiple ways:
   - Added direct token extraction from URL for more robust handling
   - Implemented fallback methods when standard parsing fails
   - Added token validation via direct API call as last resort

3. **Deep Linking**: Enhanced deep link handling:
   - Added global navigation reference for better screen navigation after auth
   - Improved error handling with better user feedback
   - Added delayed alerts to ensure they appear after the browser closes

4. **User Experience**: Made the auth flow more user-friendly:
   - Added guidance alerts before starting the auth process
   - Provided clear instructions on how to return to the app
   - Added proper error recovery with manual token entry options

## Using the Fixed Version

When connecting to your Fitbit account:

1. Tap "Sign in with Fitbit" on the FitbitConnect screen
2. You will be guided through the process with helpful alerts
3. After signing in on the Fitbit website, you should be automatically redirected back to the app
4. If you encounter any issues, you can use the manual token entry as a fallback

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter authentication issues:

1. **Manual Token Entry**: Use the "Having trouble connecting? Tap here" option on the Fitbit Connect screen
2. **Check Network**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
3. **Close Browser**: Make sure to close any open browser tabs from previous auth attempts
4. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing the app cache or reinstalling if problems persist

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

1. App opens Fitbit authorization URL in a browser
2. User signs in and approves access
3. Fitbit redirects back to the app with a token in the URL
4. App extracts the token and validates it with Fitbit API
5. On success, the app stores the token and loads user profile data

### Key Components

- `FitbitAuthService.ts`: Handles OAuth authentication with Fitbit
- `HeartRateService.ts`: Manages token handling and heart rate data
- `App.tsx`: Configures deep linking and initial token handling
- `FitbitConnectScreen.tsx`: Provides UI for authentication

This fix ensures the OAuth callback is properly handled and the token is correctly extracted from the redirect URL, resolving the connection issues previously experienced.

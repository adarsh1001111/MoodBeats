# Changes to Fix Fitbit OAuth Integration

## Overview

The Fitbit OAuth integration has been completely reworked to use Expo's AuthSession module, which provides a secure and reliable way to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication in Expo applications. The previous implementation was using a custom URL scheme that wasn't compatible with how Expo handles deep linking in development mode.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Required Dependencies**
   - `expo-auth-session`: For handling the OAuth flow
   - `expo-web-browser`: For opening the authorization page in a browser
   - `expo-crypto`: Required peer dependency for expo-auth-session

2. **Created Proper Auth Service**
   - Implemented a new `FitbitAuthService` that uses Expo's AuthSession
   - Added proper error handling and logging
   - Fixed token storage and management

3. **Updated API Integration**
   - Ensured the HeartRateService correctly interfaces with the new auth service
   - Added better error handling for API failures

4. **Fixed Deep Linking**
   - Updated app.json with correct deep linking configuration
   - Set up proper event listeners in App.tsx
   - Ensured the redirect URI is correctly generated

5. **Fixed UI**
   - Updated the FitbitConnectScreen to work with the new auth flow
   - Fixed incorrect Ionicons name that was causing warnings

6. **Added Documentation**
   - Created FITBIT_SETUP.md with detailed instructions
   - Added inline code comments for better maintainability

## Key Implementation Notes

The main architectural changes include:

1. **Using Expo's AuthSession Flow**: This replaces the custom URL scheme approach and ensures proper redirect handling.

2. **Implicit Grant Flow**: We're using the recommended flow for mobile applications, which returns the access token directly without requiring a client secret.

3. **Proxy-based Auth**: Using Expo's authentication proxy to handle the redirect, which works well in both development and production.

4. **Better Token Management**: Improved storage and validation of authentication tokens.

## How to Test

Follow the instructions in FITBIT_SETUP.md to update your Fitbit Developer Portal settings and test the new implementation. The key requirement is setting the correct Callback URL in the Fitbit Developer Portal to match the URL generated by AuthSession.

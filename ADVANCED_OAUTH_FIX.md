# Advanced OAuth Direct Token Fix

This document explains the advanced fix implemented to resolve the Fitbit OAuth authentication redirect issues in the MoodBeats app.

## The Challenge

Mobile apps face a fundamental challenge with OAuth authentication:

1. The app opens a browser for the OAuth authentication
2. User authenticates on the Fitbit website
3. Fitbit redirects to the specified redirect URI with the token
4. The browser needs to return control to the app with the token

The main issue occurs in step 4: many mobile browsers don't properly support transferring the token back to the app. This is a common problem in mobile OAuth workflows.

## Our Solution

We've implemented a more robust direct token transfer approach:

### 1. Custom URI Scheme Handling

- Created a specialized `moodbeats://auth-token/TOKEN` URI format
- The app is configured to respond to this specific URI pattern
- Deep links with this format are prioritized and processed differently
- Token is extracted directly from the URI path (more reliable)

### 2. Multi-layered Token Transfer

We implemented multiple transfer methods that try in sequence:

1. **Hidden iframe**: Uses a hidden iframe to trigger the custom URI scheme
2. **Direct window.location**: Attempts a direct app URI launch
3. **JavaScript bridge**: Provides a bridge script to facilitate token transfer
4. **Multiple URI formats**: Tries various formats (hash fragment, query params, etc.)
5. **Fallback to manual**: If all else fails, the token is displayed for manual copy

### 3. Code Updates

The following changes have been made:

1. **App.tsx**: 
   - Added custom URI scheme handler
   - Prioritized direct token detection
   - Implemented token path extraction

2. **Netlify Redirect Page**:
   - Added bridge.js script
   - Implemented multiple token transfer methods
   - Added immediate token extraction and transfer attempts
   - Improved UI to better guide users during the process

3. **HeartRateService**:
   - Added direct token path handling
   - Improved token extraction from various URI formats

## How It Works

1. User starts Fitbit authentication in the app
2. App shows a helpful message about the process
3. User authenticates on the Fitbit website
4. Fitbit redirects to our Netlify page with the token
5. Netlify page tries multiple methods to return the token to the app:
   - Direct URI scheme: `moodbeats://auth-token/TOKEN`
   - JavaScript bridge attempts
   - Multiple redirect attempts with different URI formats
6. App detects the incoming token and processes it automatically
7. If all automatic methods fail, user can copy the token manually

## Technical Implementation

### Custom URI Scheme

The `moodbeats://auth-token/TOKEN` format was chosen because:

1. It places the token in the path (more reliable than query params)
2. It uses a specific endpoint that can be prioritized in handling
3. It's compatible with both Android and iOS deep linking

### Token Transport Methods

We've implemented multiple transport layers to maximize success:

1. **iframe Method**: Uses a hidden iframe to trigger the URI scheme without navigating away
2. **Location Method**: Uses window.location to directly navigate
3. **Delayed Cascade**: Tries methods in sequence with delays to avoid conflicts
4. **Direct Path Extraction**: Extracts token directly from the path for higher reliability

## Testing

The fix can be tested by:

1. Starting the app
2. Going to the Fitbit Connect screen
3. Tapping "Sign in with Fitbit"
4. Completing authentication on the Fitbit website
5. Watching as the token is automatically transferred back to the app

If for any reason the automatic methods fail, the Netlify page will display the token for manual entry.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Implement a WebView-based approach instead of browser-based OAuth
2. Add a native OAuth library for more direct integration
3. Implement the PKCE OAuth flow for enhanced security
4. Create platform-specific handlers for deeper OS integration

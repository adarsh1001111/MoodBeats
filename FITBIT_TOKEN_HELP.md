# Fitbit Token Help

If you're experiencing issues with your Fitbit connection, follow these steps:

   - This will remove any expired or invalid tokens

2. **Reconnect Your Fitbit**:
   - Go to the Connect screen
   - Tap "Sign in with Fitbit"
   - Follow the authentication process

3. **If Authorization Fails**:
   - Try the manual token option
   - You can get a token from [Fitbit Developer Site](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/oauth2/redirect)

4. **Check Connection Status**:
   - The connection screen will show if your token is valid or invalid
   - If it shows "Connection Error", follow the disconnect and reconnect steps

5. **Force Restart the App**:
   - If all else fails, completely close and restart the app
